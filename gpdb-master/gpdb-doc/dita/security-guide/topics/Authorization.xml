    <title>Access Permissions and Roles</title>
    <body>
      <p>Greenplum Database manages database access permissions using <i>roles</i>. The concept of
        roles subsumes the concepts of users and groups. A role can be a database user, a group, or
        both. Roles can own database objects (for example, tables) and can assign privileges on
        those objects to other roles to control access to the objects. Roles can be members of other
        roles, thus a member role can inherit the object privileges of its parent role. </p>
      <p>Every Greenplum Database system contains a set of database roles (users and groups). Those
        roles are separate from the users and groups managed by the operating system on which the
        server runs. However, for convenience you may want to maintain a relationship between
        operating system user names and Greenplum Database role names, since many of the client
        applications use the current operating system user name as the default. </p>
      <p> In Greenplum Database, users log in and connect through the master instance, which
        verifies their role and access privileges. The master then issues out commands to the
        segment instances behind the scenes using the currently logged in role. </p>
      <p> Roles are defined at the system level, so they are valid for all databases in the system. </p>
      <p> To bootstrap the Greenplum Database system, a freshly initialized system always contains
        one predefined superuser role (also referred to as the system user). This role will have the
        same name as the operating system user that initialized the Greenplum Database system.
        Customarily, this role is named <codeph>gpadmin</codeph>. To create more roles you first
        must connect as this initial role. </p>

    <title>Managing Object Privileges</title>
    <body>
      <p> When an object (table, view, sequence, database, function, language, schema, or
        tablespace) is created, it is assigned an owner. The owner is normally the role that
        ran the creation statement. For most kinds of objects, the initial state is that only
        the owner (or a superuser) can do anything with the object. To allow other roles to use it,
        privileges must be granted. Greenplum Database supports the following privileges for each
        object type: </p>

      <p> Privileges must be granted for each object individually. For example, granting
          <codeph>ALL</codeph> on a database does not grant full access to the objects within that
        database. It only grants all of the database-level privileges (<codeph>CONNECT</codeph>,
          <codeph>CREATE</codeph>, <codeph>TEMPORARY</codeph>) to the database itself. </p>
      <p> Use the <codeph>GRANT</codeph> SQL command to give a specified role privileges on an
        object. For example: <codeblock>=# GRANT INSERT ON mytable TO jsmith; </codeblock></p>
      <p> To revoke privileges, use the <codeph>REVOKE</codeph> command. For example:
        <codeblock>=# REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON mytable FROM jsmith; </codeblock></p>
      <p> You can also use the <codeph>DROP OWNED</codeph> and <codeph>REASSIGN OWNED</codeph>
        commands for managing objects owned by deprecated roles. (Note: only an object's owner or a
        superuser can drop an object or reassign ownership.) For example:
        <codeblock> =# REASSIGN OWNED BY sally TO bob;
 =# DROP OWNED BY visitor; </codeblock></p>

    <title>Restricting Access by Time</title>
    <body>
      <p> Greenplum Database enables the administrator to restrict access to certain times by role.
        Use the <codeph>CREATE ROLE</codeph> or <codeph>ALTER ROLE</codeph> commands to specify
        time-based constraints. </p>
      <p> Access can be restricted by day or by day and time. The constraints are removable without
        deleting and recreating the role. </p>
      <p> Time-based constraints only apply to the role to which they are assigned. If a role is a
        member of another role that contains a time constraint, the time constraint is not
        inherited. </p>
      <p> Time-based constraints are enforced only during login. The <codeph>SET ROLE</codeph> and
          <codeph>SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION</codeph> commands are not affected by any time-based
        constraints. </p>
      <p> Superuser or <codeph>CREATEROLE</codeph> privileges are required to set time-based
        constraints for a role. No one can add time-based constraints to a superuser. </p>
      <p> There are two ways to add time-based constraints. Use the keyword <codeph>DENY</codeph> in
        the <codeph>CREATE ROLE</codeph> or <codeph>ALTER ROLE</codeph> command followed by one of
        the following. <ul id="ul_bjq_jz2_jr">
          <li> A day, and optionally a time, when access is restricted. For example, no access on
            Wednesdays. </li>
          <li> An interval—that is, a beginning and ending day and optional time—when access is
            restricted. For example, no access from Wednesday 10 p.m. through Thursday at 8 a.m.
          </li>
        </ul></p>
      <p> You can specify more than one restriction; for example, no access Wednesdays at any time
        and no access on Fridays between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.  </p>
      <p> There are two ways to specify a day. Use the word <codeph>DAY</codeph> followed by either
        the English term for the weekday, in single quotation marks, or a number between 0 and 6, as
        shown in the table below. </p>

      <p> A time of day is specified in either 12- or 24-hour format. The word <codeph>TIME</codeph>
        is followed by the specification in single quotation marks. Only hours and minutes are
        specified and are separated by a colon ( : ). If using a 12-hour format, add
          <codeph>AM</codeph> or <codeph>PM</codeph> at the end. The following examples show various

      <codeblock>DROP DENY FOR DAY 'Sunday' </codeblock>
      <p> Any constraint containing all or part of the conditions in a DROP clause is removed. For
