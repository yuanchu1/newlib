# pg_stat_all_tables 

The `pg_stat_all_tables` view shows one row for each table in the current database \(including TOAST tables\) to display statistics about accesses to that specific table.

The `pg_stat_user_tables` and `pg_stat_sys_table`s views contain the same information, but filtered to only show user and system tables respectively.
