where *command* is:

```

| list-backups

| help [<command>]
```

## <a id="cmds"></a>Commands 

`delete-backup timestamp`
:   Deletes the backup set with the specified timestamp.

`display-report timestamp`
:   Displays the backup report for a specified timestamp.

`encrypt-password`
:   Encrypts plain-text passwords for storage in the DD Boost plugin configuration file.

`list-backups`
:   Displays a list of backups that have been taken. If the backup history file does not exist, the command exits with an error message. See [Table 1](#table_yls_rgw_g3b) for a description of the columns in this list.

`replicate-backup timestamp`
:   For a backup on a Data Domain server, replicates the backup to a second \(remote\) Data Domain server. The timestamp is the timestamp of the backup on the Data Domain server. The `--plugin-config config-file` option specifies the DD Boost configuration file that contains the information to access the backup and the remote Data Domain server. For information about the configuration file, see [Using the DD Boost Storage Plugin with gpbackup, gprestore, and gpbackup\_manager](../../admin_guide/managing/backup-ddboost-plugin.html). For information about replicating backups, see [Replicating Backups](../../admin_guide/managing/replication-ddb.html)

`help command`
:   Displays a help message for the specified command.

## <a id="opts"></a>Options 

--plugin-config config-file
:   The `delete-backup` command requires this option if the backup is stored in S3 or a Data Domain system. The `encrypt-password` command requires this option.
    **Note:** When you delete backup sets stored in a Data Domain system, you must pass in the same configuration file that was passed in when the backups were created. Otherwise, the `gpbackup_manager delete-backup` command will exit with an error.

-h \| --help
:   Displays a help message for the `gpbackup_manager` command. For help on a specific `gpbackup_manager` command, enter `gpbackup_manager help command`. For example:
    ```
    $ gpbackup_manager help encrypt-password
    ```

## <a id="desc"></a>Description 

The `gpbackup_manager` utility manages backup sets created using the [`gpbackup`](gpbackup.html) utility. You can list backups, display a report for a backup, and delete a backup. `gpbackup_manager` can also encrypt passwords to store in a DD Boost plugin configuration file.

Greenplum Database must be running to use the `gpbackup_manager` utility.

Backup history is saved on the Greenplum Database master host in the file `$MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY/gpbackup_history.yaml`. If no backups have been created yet, or if the backup history has been deleted, `gpbackup_manager` commands that depend on the file will display an error message and exit. If the backup history contains invalid YAML syntax, a yaml error message is displayed.

Versions of `gpbackup` earlier than v1.13.0 did not save the backup duration in the backup history file. The `list-backups` command duration column is empty for these backups.

The `encrypt-password` command is used to encrypt Data Domain user passwords that are saved in a DD Boost plug-In configuration file. To use this option, the `pgcrypto` extension must be enabled in the Greenplum Database `postgres` database. See the Tanzu Greenplum Backup and Restore installation instructions for help installing `pgcrypto`.

The `encrypt-password` command prompts you to enter and then re-enter the password to be encrypted. To maintain password secrecy, characters entered are echoed as asterisks. If replication is enabled in the specified DD Boost configuration file, the command also prompts for a password for the remote Data Domain account. You must then copy the output of the command into the DD Boost configuration file.

The following table describes the contents of the columns in the list that is output by the `gpbackup_manager list-backups` command.
